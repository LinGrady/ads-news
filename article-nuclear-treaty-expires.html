                                <p class="lead"><strong>GENEVA (AP) — February 10, 2026 —</strong> The last remaining nuclear arms control treaty between the United States and Russia officially expired at midnight on February 5, 2026, marking the end of decades-long bilateral nuclear arms control efforts and raising global security concerns among international experts who warn that the absence of verification mechanisms and deployment limits could potentially trigger a new nuclear arms race reminiscent of Cold War tensions that defined international relations throughout the latter half of the twentieth century.</p>

                                <p>The New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START), which had limited both nations' deployed strategic nuclear warheads to 1,550 each since its implementation in 2011, represented the final pillar of the nuclear arms control architecture that had governed US-Russian nuclear relations for over fifty years. The treaty's expiration eliminates critical verification procedures, on-site inspections, and data exchanges that provided transparency and predictability in nuclear weapons deployment.</p>

                                <p>"The expiration of New START represents a watershed moment in international security," said United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres in a statement issued February 4. "The international community loses an essential mechanism for nuclear risk reduction at a time when global tensions are already elevated."</p>

                                <p>The treaty, originally signed in 2010 and extended for five years in 2021, had successfully limited the world's two largest nuclear arsenals while providing unprecedented transparency through 18 on-site inspections annually and regular data exchanges on nuclear weapons systems, locations, and deployment status. Its elimination removes these confidence-building measures that had helped prevent miscalculation and misunderstanding between the nuclear superpowers.</p>

                                <p>International security experts express particular concern about the timing of the treaty's expiration, occurring amid heightened geopolitical tensions related to ongoing conflicts, alliance realignments, and technological advances in nuclear weapons delivery systems. The absence of arms control constraints comes as both nations are reportedly developing new nuclear weapons systems and delivery platforms.</p>

                                <p>"We are entering uncharted territory in nuclear arms control," noted Dr. Elena Volkov, nuclear policy specialist at the Geneva Center for Security Policy. "The verification mechanisms and deployment limits that provided stability for decades are now gone, creating uncertainty about future nuclear weapons development and deployment patterns."</p>

                                <p>The treaty's expiration affects not only US-Russian bilateral relations but also has broader implications for global nuclear non-proliferation efforts. Other nuclear-armed nations, including China, France, and the United Kingdom, have closely monitored the treaty's status as an indicator of great power commitment to arms control agreements. The failure to extend or replace New START could potentially undermine broader non-proliferation objectives and encourage nuclear weapons development in other nations.</p>

                                <p>NATO allies have expressed concern about the security implications of the treaty's termination, particularly regarding alliance nuclear sharing arrangements and extended deterrence commitments. European nations, historically most affected by US-Russian nuclear competition, face renewed questions about their security architecture and defense planning assumptions.</p>

                                <p>"European security is directly affected by US-Russian nuclear relations," stated Jens Stoltenberg, NATO Secretary-General, during a recent press conference. "We urge both parties to consider the broader implications of arms control collapse and work toward new agreements that ensure strategic stability."</p>

                                <p>The nuclear industry's technical aspects are also affected, as the treaty's elimination removes scientific and technical cooperation opportunities that had developed over decades of arms control implementation. Nuclear weapons laboratories and research facilities in both nations had established professional relationships and technical exchanges that contributed to nuclear safety and security expertise.</p>

                                <p>Arms control advocates emphasize that the treaty's expiration represents not just the loss of numerical limits but also the elimination of institutional knowledge and diplomatic infrastructure developed over multiple decades. The specialized personnel, procedures, and protocols established under New START cannot be easily recreated if political conditions change in the future.</p>

                                <p>"The human capital and institutional memory built through decades of arms control implementation represent invaluable assets for international security," explained Michael Thompson, senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. "Once lost, these capabilities take years to rebuild, even under favorable political circumstances."</p>

                                <p>The business and economic implications extend beyond direct security concerns, as the absence of arms control predictability affects defense planning, military procurement, and international trade relationships. Defense contractors and aerospace companies in both nations must now plan without clear guidance about future weapons systems limitations and deployment parameters.</p>

                                <p>International humanitarian organizations have also expressed concern about the treaty's expiration, noting that nuclear weapons represent existential threats to human civilization. The International Committee of the Red Cross and other humanitarian groups have consistently advocated for nuclear arms reduction and eventual elimination as essential for human security.</p>

                                <p>"The humanitarian consequences of any nuclear weapons use are unacceptable," stated Peter Maurer, former president of the International Committee of the Red Cross. "The international community must redouble efforts to prevent nuclear weapons use and work toward their complete elimination."</p>

                                <p>Looking ahead, diplomatic efforts to address the arms control vacuum face significant challenges, including deteriorated US-Russian relations, technological changes in nuclear weapons systems, and evolving strategic doctrines that emphasize new domains such as cyber and space. Traditional arms control approaches may require adaptation to address contemporary security challenges effectively.</p>

                                <p>Some experts suggest that future arms control agreements might need to include additional nuclear-armed nations, address emerging technologies, and incorporate new verification technologies. However, expanding arms control beyond bilateral US-Russian frameworks presents complex diplomatic and technical challenges that require sustained international cooperation.</p>

                                <p>"The future of nuclear arms control depends on political will and diplomatic creativity," noted Ambassador Thomas Countryman, former US Assistant Secretary of State for International Security and Non-proliferation. "The international community must develop new approaches that address contemporary security challenges while maintaining the fundamental objective of reducing nuclear risks."</p>

                                <p>The coming months will likely reveal whether the treaty's expiration represents a temporary setback or a fundamental shift away from nuclear arms control as a tool of international security. Historical precedent suggests that periods of arms control absence often precede renewed diplomatic efforts, though the timeline and circumstances for such initiatives remain uncertain in the current geopolitical environment.</p>

                                <p>As nations adapt to the post-New START security environment, the international community faces renewed questions about nuclear weapons' role in international relations, the effectiveness of arms control agreements, and the broader architecture of global security governance. The answers to these questions will significantly influence international peace and security for decades to come.</p>
