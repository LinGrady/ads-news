                                <p class="lead"><strong>GUANGZHOU, China (AP) — February 11, 2026 —</strong> Leaders from 21 Asia-Pacific nations gathered Tuesday in Guangzhou for the opening of the 2026 Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit, where they emphasized the importance of maintaining open trade routes and deepening regional economic integration amid growing concerns about protectionism, supply chain disruptions, and the lingering effects of global economic uncertainty that have complicated trade relationships across the world's most economically dynamic region.</p>

                                <p>The summit, hosted by China for the first time since 2014, brings together leaders representing economies that account for approximately 60 percent of global GDP and nearly half of world trade. The meeting occurs at a critical juncture for the region, as nations navigate complex geopolitical tensions while seeking to maintain the economic growth that has lifted hundreds of millions of people out of poverty over the past three decades.</p>

                                <p>"Openness and cooperation remain the defining features of our region's success," said Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi in his opening address to senior officials Tuesday morning. "We must resist the temptation to retreat into protectionism and instead work together to build an open Asia-Pacific economy that benefits all our peoples."</p>

                                <p>The 2026 summit agenda focuses on three primary themes: sustainable economic growth, digital innovation and connectivity, and inclusive development. Trade ministers and senior officials began preliminary discussions Tuesday, with leaders scheduled to hold formal meetings later in the week to adopt joint declarations and action plans.</p>

                                <p>The Asia-Pacific region has demonstrated remarkable economic resilience despite global headwinds. According to International Monetary Fund data released last week, APEC economies collectively grew 3.8 percent in 2025, outpacing the global average of 2.9 percent. However, the region faces significant challenges, including demographic shifts, climate change impacts, and evolving trade relationships with major partners outside the bloc.</p>

                                <p>Trade liberalization remains a central focus of APEC discussions, even as global trade negotiations have stalled at the World Trade Organization level. APEC operates on a non-binding basis, emphasizing consensus-building and voluntary cooperation rather than formal treaty obligations, an approach that has allowed the forum to maintain relevance even as other multilateral institutions have struggled.</p>

                                <p>"APEC's strength lies in its flexibility and pragmatism," noted Dr. Mari Pangestu, former Indonesian trade minister and current professor at Columbia University. "While other forums get bogged down in legalistic negotiations, APEC focuses on practical cooperation that delivers tangible benefits for businesses and consumers."</p>

                                <p>Digital trade has emerged as a major priority for the 2026 summit, with member economies seeking to establish common standards for cross-border data flows, e-commerce regulations, and digital payments systems. The rapid growth of digital trade in the Asia-Pacific region, accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, has highlighted both opportunities and regulatory challenges.</p>

                                <p>A recent study by the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Policy Support Unit estimated that digital trade facilitation measures could add $1.7 trillion to regional GDP by 2030. However, differing approaches to data privacy, cybersecurity, and digital taxation have created barriers that APEC leaders hope to address through enhanced cooperation.</p>

                                <p>Supply chain resilience represents another key agenda item, reflecting lessons learned from pandemic-related disruptions and ongoing geopolitical tensions. APEC members are exploring mechanisms to diversify supply chains, improve transparency, and establish early warning systems for potential disruptions.</p>

                                <p>"The pandemic exposed vulnerabilities in our global supply chains that we cannot ignore," said Singapore's Trade Minister Gan Kim Yong during Tuesday's opening sessions. "APEC has a crucial role to play in building more resilient, sustainable, and inclusive supply chains that can withstand future shocks."</p>

                                <p>Climate change and sustainable development feature prominently in this year's summit discussions. APEC economies account for approximately 60 percent of global carbon emissions, making regional cooperation essential for achieving international climate goals. Leaders are expected to announce new initiatives on clean energy transition, sustainable agriculture, and ocean conservation.</p>

                                <p>The business community has actively engaged with the summit through the APEC Business Advisory Council (ABAC), which represents private sector interests. ABAC Chairman Kriengkrai Thiennukul of Thailand presented recommendations Tuesday calling for accelerated implementation of the APEC Internet and Digital Economy Roadmap and enhanced support for small and medium enterprises.</p>

                                <p>Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) employ over half the workforce in most APEC economies but often struggle to access international markets. Summit discussions include proposals to expand trade financing, simplify customs procedures, and provide digital tools to help SMEs participate more effectively in global trade.</p>

                                <p>Geopolitical tensions, particularly between the United States and China, have complicated APEC's traditional focus on economic cooperation. While both countries participate in APEC meetings, their strategic competition has increasingly influenced regional economic discussions. Other APEC members have sought to maintain productive relationships with both powers while advancing their own economic interests.</p>

                                <p>"APEC provides a valuable platform for maintaining dialogue even when bilateral relationships are strained," observed Dr. Yuen Pau Woo, former Canadian senator and Asia-Pacific policy expert. "The economic interdependence among APEC members creates strong incentives for continued cooperation despite political differences."</p>

                                <p>The summit also addresses regional development disparities, with advanced economies like the United States, Japan, and Australia joining developing nations such as Papua New Guinea and Vietnam in discussions about inclusive growth. APEC's Bogor Goals, established in 1994, called for free and open trade and investment in the region by 2020, a target that was extended due to implementation challenges.</p>

                                <p>Progress toward trade liberalization has been uneven, with some sectors achieving significant tariff reductions while others remain heavily protected. Non-tariff barriers, including regulatory differences and standards divergence, continue to impede trade flows despite years of APEC-led cooperation initiatives.</p>

                                <p>Looking beyond the immediate summit, APEC members are discussing long-term visions for regional economic integration. Proposals include expanding the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), deepening the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), and exploring new forms of digital economy cooperation.</p>

                                <p>The outcomes of this week's summit will be closely watched by global markets and policymakers, as APEC's approach to economic cooperation often influences broader international discussions. While APEC decisions are not legally binding, the forum's consensus-based approach can generate momentum for policy changes at the national level.</p>

                                <p>As the summit continues through the week, leaders will face the challenge of balancing ambitious cooperative goals with the practical constraints of domestic politics and competing national interests. The success of APEC 2026 will ultimately be measured not by the commitments made in Guangzhou, but by the concrete actions taken by member economies in the months and years ahead.</p>
