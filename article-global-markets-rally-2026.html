                                <p class="lead"><strong>NEW YORK (AP) — February 11, 2026 —</strong> Global stock markets rallied sharply on Tuesday as technology companies led a broad-based recovery, with major indices posting their biggest gains in months amid renewed investor optimism driven by stronger-than-expected corporate earnings, improving economic indicators, and hopes that central banks may soon conclude their aggressive interest rate hiking campaigns that have weighed on equity markets throughout the past year.</p>

                                <p>The S&P 500 surged 2.8 percent, its largest single-day gain since November 2025, while the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite jumped 3.4 percent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 850 points, closing above 45,000 for the first time since early January. European and Asian markets followed Wall Street's lead, with major indices in London, Frankfurt, Tokyo, and Hong Kong all posting significant gains.</p>

                                <p>"The market is pricing in a Goldilocks scenario," said Michael Roberts, chief investment strategist at Global Asset Management. "We have strong earnings, moderating inflation, and a resilient economy. That's a powerful combination for equity markets."</p>

                                <p>Technology stocks, which had been under pressure in recent weeks due to concerns about high valuations and rising interest rates, led Tuesday's rally. Apple gained 4.2 percent after reporting better-than-expected quarterly revenue driven by strong iPhone sales and growth in its services division. Microsoft rose 3.8 percent as investors cheered the company's artificial intelligence initiatives and cloud computing growth.</p>

                                <p>Alphabet, Google's parent company, surged 5.1 percent after announcing plans to expand its cloud infrastructure and integrate advanced AI capabilities across its product lineup. The company reported quarterly revenue that exceeded analyst expectations, with particular strength in its advertising and cloud computing segments.</p>

                                <p>The rally extended beyond mega-cap technology stocks. Smaller technology companies, as measured by the Russell 2000 index, gained 2.1 percent, suggesting broad-based optimism about the sector's prospects. Semiconductor stocks were particularly strong, with the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index rising 4.5 percent amid reports of improving chip demand.</p>

                                <p>Economic data released Tuesday provided additional support for the rally. The Labor Department reported that inflation moderated more than expected in January, with the Consumer Price Index rising 2.3 percent year-over-year, down from 2.9 percent in December and below economist forecasts of 2.5 percent. Core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, also came in below expectations.</p>

                                <p>"The inflation data is a game-changer," said Sarah Chen, chief economist at Investment Research Partners. "If inflation continues to moderate at this pace, the Federal Reserve will have much more flexibility in monetary policy. Markets are increasingly pricing in rate cuts later this year."</p>

                                <p>Federal Reserve officials have signaled that they are nearing the end of their rate-hiking cycle, with futures markets now pricing in three to four rate cuts by the end of 2026. The central bank raised interest rates aggressively from early 2022 through late 2025 to combat inflation that had reached multi-decade highs.</p>

                                <p>Corporate earnings season has provided additional fuel for the rally. With approximately 70 percent of S&P 500 companies having reported fourth-quarter results, earnings are on track to grow 8.5 percent year-over-year, well above the 5.2 percent growth analysts had forecast at the beginning of the reporting period. Revenue growth has also exceeded expectations, with companies reporting top-line growth of 4.2 percent.</p>

                                <p>"Companies have demonstrated remarkable resilience in navigating a challenging economic environment," noted David Park, equity strategist at Capital Markets Research. "Cost discipline, pricing power, and operational efficiency have allowed companies to protect margins even as revenue growth has moderated."</p>

                                <p>The financial sector has been a standout performer during earnings season, with major banks reporting strong profits driven by higher interest rates and robust trading activity. JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, and Goldman Sachs all exceeded earnings expectations, with executives expressing confidence about the economic outlook despite lingering concerns about commercial real estate exposure.</p>

                                <p>International markets also benefited from the positive sentiment. In Europe, the STOXX 600 index gained 2.1 percent, with technology and industrial stocks leading the advance. Asian markets posted strong gains overnight, with Japan's Nikkei 225 rising 2.6 percent and Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index jumping 3.1 percent.</p>

                                <p>China's markets were particularly strong, with the Shanghai Composite Index gaining 2.3 percent amid reports that the government is preparing additional stimulus measures to support the slowing economy. Chinese technology stocks listed in Hong Kong surged, with the Hang Seng Tech Index rising 4.2 percent.</p>

                                <p>Commodity markets reflected the improved economic outlook, with crude oil prices rising 3.2 percent to $78 per barrel and copper futures gaining 2.8 percent. Gold prices, which typically rise during periods of uncertainty, fell 1.2 percent as investors rotated into riskier assets.</p>

                                <p>Bond markets also responded to the shifting economic outlook, with yields on 10-year Treasury notes rising 12 basis points to 4.15 percent. The yield curve, which had been inverted for much of the past two years in a signal of recession risk, has steepened considerably in recent weeks.</p>

                                <p>While Tuesday's rally was broad-based, some analysts cautioned that markets may have gotten ahead of themselves in pricing in a perfect economic outcome. Geopolitical risks remain elevated, with ongoing conflicts in multiple regions and tensions between major powers. Additionally, the full impact of past interest rate hikes may not yet have filtered through to the broader economy.</p>

                                <p>"Markets are pricing in a lot of good news," warned Jennifer Walsh, risk management director at Portfolio Strategies Group. "Investors should remain mindful that the path forward is unlikely to be as smooth as today's price action suggests."</p>

                                <p>Looking ahead, market participants will be closely watching upcoming economic data releases, including retail sales figures, industrial production data, and housing market indicators. Federal Reserve officials are scheduled to give several speeches this week, with investors parsing their comments for clues about the future path of monetary policy.</p>

                                <p>For now, however, investors are enjoying a respite from the volatility that has characterized markets over the past year. Tuesday's rally demonstrated that despite lingering concerns about valuations and economic uncertainty, there remains substantial appetite for equities when the economic outlook brightens.</p>
